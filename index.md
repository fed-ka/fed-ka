I am a writer, researcher, and teacher currently living in Brooklyn, New York. I completed my Ph.D. in English and Interdisciplinary Humanities at Princeton University in May 2024. Currently, I am a writing associate at the Columbia Writing Center, which I hold at the rank of Lecturer in the Department of English. My peer-reviewed academic articles have been published or are forthcoming in _English Literary History_, _American Literary History_, and a joint issue of _Modernism/Modernity_ and _Cultural Analytics_. I have taught literature and composition classes at Princeton (English), NYU (Core Curriculum), and at Northern State Prison through the Princeton Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI).
