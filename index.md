I'm a writer slash researcher based out of Montreal, Canada. I do a mix of [data journalism](http://www.jfgagne.ai/talent/), [content writing](https://blog.coveo.com/author/fedor-karmanov/), and quantitative research for startups, tech companies, and educational institutions. 

You can find my CV on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedor-karmanov-91578021/) and some of my coding bits on [Github](https://github.com/fed-ka). If you would like to get in touch regarding a project, [feel free to email me.](mailto:fedor.karmanov@gmail.com)
