I am currently a joint doctoral candidate in the [English Department](https://english.princeton.edu/people/fedor-karmanov) and the [Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in the Humanities](https://ihum.princeton.edu/people/fedor-karmanov) at Princeton University. My research interests include twentieth-century world literature, literary translation, science and technology studies, and critical theory. 

My dissertation, titled "Simultaneity: Multiple Invention in Literary Form," attempts to theorize why certain artistic forms, techniques, and genres emerge independently — in different languages and countries  — at the same time. I am affiliated with the [Center for the Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/people/students/) and the [Program in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies](https://reees.princeton.edu/people/graduate-students). Two of my academic articles are forthcoming in _American Literary History_ and a joint issue of _Modernism/modernity_ and _Cultural Analytics_.
