I am a writer, researcher, and teacher currently living in Brooklyn, New York. At present, I am a [Postgraduate Research Associate](https://english.princeton.edu/people/fedor-karmanov) in the [English Department](https://english.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, where I completed my Ph.D. in English and Interdisciplinary Humanities in May, 2024. My peer-reviewed academic articles have been published or are forthcoming in _English Literary History_, _American Literary History_, and a joint issue of _Modernism/Modernity_ and _Cultural Analytics_. I have taught literature and composition classes at Princeton (English), NYU (Core Curriculum), and at Northern State Prison through the Princeton Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI).
