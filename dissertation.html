<md>**Simultaneity: Multiple Invention in Literary Form**</md>
<md>_Dissertation Abstract_</md>
<md>Why do similar literary styles, forms, and genres emerge—with no known connection or mutual influence—in different places, at the same time? Inspired by research on multiple invention in the History of Science, my dissertation project, _Simultaneity: Multiple Invention in Literary Form_, explores three transnational twentieth-century examples of independent co- invention in literature: the stream-of-consciousness method, which emerged in England, France, and Russia in the 1910s; magical realism, which emerged in Cuba, Nigeria, Germany, and the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s; and concrete poetry, which emerged in Brazil, Switzerland, China, and Sweden in the 1940s and 1950s. In each chapter, _Simultaneity_ posits that new forms develop through an unconscious act of reconciliation between the artist’s subjective experience of the world, the historical conditions of their immediate context, and the dominant publishing possibilities of their time. By arguing that similar historical structures can produce similar forms in different places, this dissertation challenges the implicit Eurocentrism of nation- based literary canons, a paradigm that explains literary innovation through genealogical “influence” or economic “flows” of literary techniques that begin at the center and move to the periphery. In reimagining literary innovation as a bottom-up, horizontal process, my dissertation posits that artistic simultaneity can help us better understand the relationship between literary representation and what we might call a global, historical unconscious. In so doing, _Simultaneity_ aims to reformulate assumptions regarding the nature of creativity, innovation, and the global development of literary and artistic forms.</md>
